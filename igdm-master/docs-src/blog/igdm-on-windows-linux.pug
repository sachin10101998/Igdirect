    # Getting IG:dm running on Windows and Linux

    [IG:dm](http://igdm.me/) (Instagram Desktop Messenger) is a desktop application used for continuing 
    your Instagram chats from your mobile devices to your computer—just like WhatsApp.
    
    While IG:dm is built to support all platforms (macOS, Linux, and Windows), there are some known issues you might encounter when trying
    to get it running on your Windows or Linux machines. Here’s a list of them, and possible workarounds.
    
    ### Cannot Install on Windows 10 and Windows 8
    There have been [cases](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju/igdm/issues/70) where the windows installer crashes
    while being executed with the following error:
    
    ![Windows Error](../img/blog/winerror.png)
    
    #### There are 2 known solutions to solve this problem:
    
    - **Run it as Administrator in Windows 7 compatibility mode.** To do this:
      - Right click on setup file (i.e the IG:dm installer)
      - Go to "Properties"
      - Go to the "Compatibility" tab
      - Click on "Run this program in compatibility mode for:"
      - Select "Windows 7"
      - At the bottom tick the checkbox "Run this program as an administrator"
      - Click the "Apply" button to apply the changes
      - Then try to run the installer again

    - **Download an older [version 2.1.0](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju/igdm/releases/download/v2.1.0/IGdm-Setup-2.1.0.exe)**:
      A downside to this is that you would not be able to leverage on the newer feature and updates added to the newer versions.
    
    ### How to run it on Linux
    
    As of [version 2.3.1](https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju/igdm/releases/download/v2.3.1/IGdm-2.3.1-x86_64.AppImage),
    the Linux version of IG:dm comes as an [AppImage](https://appimage.org/) which is a format for packaging applications
    in a way that allows them to run on common Linux-based operating systems, such as RHEL, CentOS, Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and derivatives.
    
    However, in some cases, you might get the following error when you try to run it on a Linux machine:
    `This Package is not compatible`
    
    #### To fix this:
    You need to convert the IGdm AppImage file into an executable file by following the steps 
    [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/379134/how-run-appimage-with-left-click-mouse-in-deepin/379353#379353)
    
    ### Unable to Login due to 2-Factor Authentication
    Although this issue is not specific to any particular platform, it is a common issue.
    
    As of version 2.3.1, IG:dm does not have support for 
    [Instagram's two-factor authentication](https://help.instagram.com/566810106808145)
    so if you are a user with a 2-factor authentication on, you might find yourself unable to login to IG:dm
    
    #### How to fix this
    
    A current workaround for this would be to:
    - Disable two-step authentication on Instagram and then login to IG:dm
    - After logging in to IG:dm, re-enable two-step authentication.
    
    After doing this, Instagram would recognize your IG:dm device from that point on, and you would not be required to enter the 2-step
    verification code even if you log out and then log back in with IG:dm.
    
    **Disclaimer:** If you do not feel comfortable with temporarily disabling two-step authentication 
    on your account, please don't go through with it.
